nes emulator in rust. its not very good yet. check back later.

things that work!
-cycle accurate cpu core. supports all commerical and undocumented opcodes

things that are in progres!
-ppu

things that i really really dont want to work on so i probably never will!
-audio (does anyone out there actually enjoy audio programming?)

about the name: 
due to some timing errors, rendering a single frame was taking about 15 seconds. so i joked that i should be measuring performance in spf instead of fps. hence sunscreen
